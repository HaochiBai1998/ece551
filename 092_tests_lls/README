For this assignment, you will be writing test cases for your next
assignment. As usual, the instructions for the next assignment are in
next-README. 

For this assignment, you will be writing test cases (in a file called
test-lls.cpp) for an integer linked list class with the methods
given in il.hpp. While the next assignment is writing a templated linked
list class, you will only write test cases for the IntList class for
now. By now, you should be quite familiar with the idea of writing test
cases first.

We have created compiled object files (in /usr/local/ece551/lls/ where il.o
is correct, and the files with a number for 'X' in ilX.o files are each
broken in some way).

We have provided a run_all.sh script, which will compile your test-lls.cpp
with each object file, run your tests, and report if your tests failed each
broken implementation (and passed the correct one).

In il.hpp, you will see a function testList, which is a friend of IntList,
which you may define in test-lls.cpp to access private members of IntList
in your testing. For this function, think about what things should be
invariant for a linked list.

Submit your test-lls.cpp file when you are done.

==================================

Write as many mistakes and test cases as you can think of with pencil and
paper before you write any code in test-lls.cpp.

Think systematically about possible mistakes a programmer could make.

Broken 1
Start by thinking of mistakes a programmer could make with the default
constructor, and test for what head and tail should be if it was written
correctly.

Broken 2-9
Think of mistakes a programmer could make in writing addFront and addBack:
What pointers could they forget to update? What functionality could they
misunderstand?

Broken 10-16
Think about how the rule of three relates to the IntList class. What member
functions does the programmer need to write and what mistakes could they
make regarding copying, allocating, and deallocating memory?

Broken 17-26
Work out several removals by hand, and write comprehensive tests for things
that could go wrong when removing from different positions in the
list. Think carefully about where a programmer could fail to update
pointers around the node being removed.

For these tests, you may assume operator[], find, and getSize are
implemented correctly.
